# remoteStorage - a remote version of localStorage with python backend

## currently in development

Local storage is a web storage feature that allows you to store data locally on the user's browser. It is a useful tool for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences or temporary information, but it is limited to the user's device and is not accessible from other devices or locations.

Our application aims to overcome this limitation by providing a remote version of local storage. With remoteStorage application, you can store and retrieve data from a remote server, allowing you to access your data from any device or location with an internet connection. 

Our application is built using PYTHON[FASTAPI, SQLModel] and SQL database (sqlite) for backend, vanilla Javascript for frontend, and offers a simple and intuitive interface that is similar to the local storage API. In frontend you can use the same localStorage Methods to store and retrieve data, making it easy to integrate into your existing projects.
